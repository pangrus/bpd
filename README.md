Despite the apparent simplicity, this module deliver a wide sound palette.

By tuning the three cross-modulated oscillators timbral metamorphosis with complex variations in tone and granularity can be achieved.

Although sound repeatability can be achieved, the circuit nature encourages the user toward an aleatoric sound design process.

A little variation of the knob settings may result in dramatic timbral alterations, hence the name.
